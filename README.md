## Things you'll need

To interact with the OpenAI API you will need an [OpenAI platform account](https://platform.openai.com/overview). Once you have signed up, [create an API key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) from your account dashboard.

## Usage

Installation and usage is manual right now. To do so you should clone the repo and change into the new directory:

```
git clone https://github.com/philnash/asst.git
cd asst
```

Then install the dependencies:

```
npm install
```

You can then run the assistant with the command:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY node index.js
```

You can also copy the `.env.example` to `.env` and enter your API key. Then you can use the following command to run the assistant:

```
npm start
```

You can now interact with your assistant. Start by giving the assistant a system instruction for how it should behave. Once you have done that, you can chat back and forth with the assistant on the command line.
